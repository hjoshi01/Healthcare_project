# Healthcare_project
We are given a case by the CEO of a hospital system to analyse the data on patients and provide insights based
on the data analysis. The client is particularly interested in:
● Predict people who will spend a lot of money on healthcare next year (i.e., which people will have high
healthcare costs)
● Provide actionable insight to the HMO, in terms of how to lower their total health cost
Additionally, they are interested to know what drives the healthcare cost.
To provide these insights, we will first clean out data set and perform exploratory data analysis to understand
the data. This will be followed linear regression analysis that helps in predicting the cost of patients and find
which variable will affects the cost more.
Finally, we will be using different versions of supervised and unsupervised learning to find which person will
expensive or not.
